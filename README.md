# Navbar-Using-HTML-CSS-JS
A navbar made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a key part of any website’s layout. HTML builds the base structure, including the logo and menu links. CSS styles the navbar by adding colors, spacing, fonts, and responsive design with flexbox or grid. JavaScript adds simple functionality, such as opening and closing the menu on mobile devices.
